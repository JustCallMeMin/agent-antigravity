# SEO Fundamentals & Mindset

## Core Philosophy

> "Content for humans, structured for machines. Win both Google and ChatGPT."

## 1. Search is a Survival System
- Visibility equals existence. If the content cannot be found, it does not exist for the business.
- **Intent over Keywords**: Satisfying user intent is the primary ranking factor.

## 2. Your Mindset
- **User-first**: Content quality over tricks.
- **Dual-target**: Optimize for both traditional SEO and modern GEO simultaneously.
- **Data-driven**: Measure, test, iterate based on real performance metrics.
- **Future-proof**: Design for the era of AI-powered search (Search Generative Experience).

## 3. SEO Supporting Product
- SEO should never degrade the user experience (UX).
- SEO is a distribution channel, not a reason to create thin or useless pages.

## 4. Measuring Success
- Avoid vanity metrics (raw traffic).
- Focus on: qualified traffic, conversions, and share of voice for target entities.
- Distinguish between leading indicators (indexability, impressions) and lagging indicators (conversions, authority).

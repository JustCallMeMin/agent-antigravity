# SEO Fundamentals & Mindset

## 1. Search is a Survival System
- Visibility equals existence. If the content cannot be found, it does not exist for the business.
- **Intent over Keywords**: Satisfying user intent is the primary ranking factor.

## 2. The SEO Trinity
Every SEO effort must balance:
1. **Technical**: Crawlability, indexability, speed, and mobile-friendliness.
2. **Content**: Relevance, clarity, and intent satisfaction.
3. **Authority**: Trust, citations, and digital reputation.

## 3. SEO Supporting Product
- SEO should never degrade the user experience (UX).
- SEO is a distribution channel, not a reason to create thin or useless pages.

## 4. Measuring Success
- Avoid vanity metrics (raw traffic).
- Focus on: qualified traffic, conversions, and share of voice for target entities.

# Content Optimization & Structure

## Content SEO Checklist

Every content piece MUST be optimized for both human readability and machine understanding:

- [ ] **Title Tags**: Primary keyword near the start, 50-60 characters.
- [ ] **Meta Descriptions**: Compelling summary that encourages clicks, 150-160 characters.
- [ ] **Heading Hierarchy**: Exactly one `H1` per page, followed by logical `H2-H6` structure.
- [ ] **Internal Linking**: Strategic links to related content using descriptive anchor text.
- [ ] **Image Optimization**: Descriptive file names and relevant `alt` text for accessibility and search.
- [ ] **Readability**: Clear, concise language tailored to the target audience.

## Intent-First Content Design

1. **Identify the Primary Intent**: Is the user looking for information, a specific site, or a purchase?
2. **Structure for Extraction**: Use bullet points, bold text, and numbered lists to make key facts "scannable" for both users and AI agents.
3. **Depth & Value**: Answer the user's question completely. Avoid "thin content" that doesn't add value beyond what is already available.

## Prohibited Practices

- **Keyword Stuffing**: Forcing keywords unnaturally into text.
- **Hidden Text**: Content visible to search engines but not to users.
- **AI-Generated Spam**: Bulk-produced content without human review and unique value.

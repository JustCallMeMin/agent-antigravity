# GEO: Generative Engine Optimization

## 1. AI Search Mindset
- AI models (LLMs) value **extractability** and **credibility**.
- GEO is about becoming the "source of truth" for a specific query or entity.

## 2. RAG (Retrieval-Augmented Generation) Optimization
- **Chunking Friendly**: Use clear, concise paragraphs and lists.
- **Definitions First**: Start topics with "What is [X]" to satisfy initial retrieval.
- **Direct Answers**: Provide an un-nuanced answer followed by a nuanced explanation.

## 3. Citation & Attribution Strategy
- Use unique, high-value data points that AI models will want to cite.
- Maintain persistent entities (Brand Name, Unique Terms) so AI can associate them with authority.

## 4. Entity Mapping
- Connect content to known entities in the knowledge graph.
- Explicitly state relationships: "[Brand] is a [Category] specializing in [Niche]".

## 5. Frequency & Recency
- AI models with web-access prioritize "Live" signals and new information for current events/trends.

## Principles of AI Extractability

1. **Be Definitive**: State facts clearly rather than using vague or overly flowery language.
2. **Use Headers as Questions**: Aligning headers with search queries helps AI match content to user prompts.
3. **Consistency**: Ensure the same information is reinforced across multiple pages of the site.

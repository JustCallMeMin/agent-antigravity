# Animation & Effects Rules

## Purpose

Animations exist to:
- Explain state changes
- Guide attention
- Improve perceived performance

They do NOT exist for decoration.

---

## Performance First

You MUST:
- Prefer CSS over JS animations
- Avoid layout-thrashing properties
- Respect reduced-motion preferences

If animation harms performance, it is forbidden.

---

## Motion Discipline

- Animate intent, not presence
- Entrance animations must be subtle
- Avoid continuous or looping animations

---

## Depth & Feedback

- Use motion to show causality
- Feedback must be immediate
- Delays must feel intentional

---

## When to Disable Animation

You MUST disable animations if:
- They obscure content
- They slow interaction
- They confuse state changes

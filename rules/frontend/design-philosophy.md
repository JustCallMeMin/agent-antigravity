# Frontend Design Philosophy

## Purpose

This document defines the **creative and conceptual principles**
used when a task requires **distinctive, non-generic UI design**.

These rules are OPTIONAL and MUST be loaded only when the task
explicitly involves branding, visual differentiation, or creative UI.

---

## Core Beliefs

- UI is communication, not decoration
- Layout conveys hierarchy and intent
- Silence (white space) is a design tool
- Familiar patterns must be justified, not assumed

---

## Anti-Generic Principle

You MUST avoid default SaaS aesthetics unless explicitly requested.

Forbidden by default:
- Safe, symmetrical layouts
- Generic hero sections
- Predictable grid-only thinking
- Visual neutrality without intent

---

## Composition Rules

- Asymmetry is preferred over symmetry
- Visual tension is allowed if intentional
- Hierarchy must be visible without reading text
- Not everything deserves equal weight

---

## Design Commitment Rule

Every visual decision MUST answer:
- Why is this here?
- What does it communicate?
- What would break if removed?

If no answer exists → remove it.

---

## When to STOP and Ask

You MUST stop and ask if:
- Brand intent is unclear
- Target audience is undefined
- Differentiation goals are missing

Creative UI without context is forbidden.

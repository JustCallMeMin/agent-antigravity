# Product Prioritization Rules

## Purpose

Ensure the most valuable work is done first through disciplined decision-making.

---

## Prioritization Frameworks

- **MoSCoW**: Use for scope management (Must, Should, Could, Won't have).
- **RICE**: Use for objective comparisons (Reach, Impact, Confidence, Effort).
- **Cost of Delay (CoD)**: Prioritize items that lose value quickly if not shipped.

---

## Trade-off Analysis

- Document the rationale for why one item is prioritized over another.
- Be explicit about what is being DE-PRIORITIZED to make room for new requests.
- MVP Gate: Identify the absolute minimum required to test the value hypothesis.

## STOP Gate

You MUST STOP if:

- Prioritization is based solely on "loudest voice" or "HIPPO" (Highest Paid Person's Opinion).
- Resources are spread too thin across too many high-priority items.

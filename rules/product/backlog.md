# Backlog Governance Rules

## Purpose

Maintain a high-quality, transparent, and actionable Product Backlog.

---

## User Story Standards (DoR)

- **Format**: "As a [Persona], I want to [Action], so that [Benefit]."
- **Acceptance Criteria**: MUST be measurable. Gherkin-style (`Given/When/Then`) is mandatory for complex logic.
- **Independence**: Stories should follow the INVEST criteria (Independent, Negotiable, Valuable, Estimable, Small, Testable).

---

## Refinement Discipline

- **Decomposition**: Break down Epics into small, incremental stories that deliver value independently.
- **Traceability**: Link stories back to PRDs or Product Goals.
- **Readiness**: No item enters a delivery phase unless Acceptance Criteria are confirmed and risks are mitigated.

---

## STOP Gate

You MUST STOP if:

- Acceptance Criteria are open to interpretation.
- A story is too large to complete within a single iteration.
- Technical dependencies are not identified.

# Product Core Principles

## Purpose

Define foundational principles for maximizing product value and ensuring strategic alignment.

---

## Value over Output

- Focus on the impact (Why), not just the feature (What).
- A feature that doesn't solve a validated user problem is waste.
- Success is measured by user behavior change, not ticket completion.

---

## Outcome-Driven Thinking

- Every task must be traceable to a specific Product Goal or Outcome.
- Solutions must be derived from problem validation.
- Avoid the "Feature Factory" trap: quantity of features is a vanity metric.

---

## STOP Gate

You MUST STOP if:

- The business objective is unclear.
- There is no hypothesis for how the work creates value.
- The work directly contradicts the defined Product Vision.

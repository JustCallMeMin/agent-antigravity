# Stakeholder Management Rules

## Purpose

Align expectations and handle requirements from multiple sources effectively.

---

## Alignment Principles

- **Signals, not Orders**: Treat stakeholder requests as signals of needs, not direct implementation orders.
- **Conflict Resolution**: Use the Product Vision and Goals as the tie-breaker for conflicting requests.
- **Transparency**: Communicate the "Why" behind de-prioritization clearly with data/evidence.

---

## Communication Protocol

- Translate technical constraints into business impact for stakeholders.
- Translate business "vibe" into technical "spec" for developers.
- Validate major scope shifts with key stakeholders before finalizing.

---

## STOP Gate

You MUST STOP if:

- A stakeholder request violates security or data integrity.
- Conflicting requirements from high-authority stakeholders have not been reconciled.

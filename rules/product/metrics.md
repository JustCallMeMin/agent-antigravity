# Product Metrics & Health Rules

## Purpose

Measure outcomes and validate value hypotheses.

---

## Metric Classification

- **Outcome Metrics**: Measure the desired business result (e.g., Conversion rate, Retention).
- **Output Metrics**: Measure the scale of work (e.g., Velocity, Throughput) - use sparingly.
- **Health Metrics**: Monitor system and process stability (e.g., Tech debt ratio, Bug count).

## Success Criteria

- Every PRD or major story MUST have success criteria defined upfront.
- "Completed" is not a success criterion; "Users achieved X" is.
- Establish a baseline before deploying changes to measure uplift.

---

## STOP Gate

You MUST STOP if:

- Success is not measurable or defined.
- Metrics are solely focused on "quantity" without "quality/value".

# Product Discovery Rules

## Purpose

Define how to validate problems and explore solutions with high confidence.

---

## Requirements Elicitation

- **Exploratory Questions**: Always ask "Why?" until the root problem is identified.
- **Implicit vs. Explicit**: Extract implicit assumptions and turn them into explicit requirements.
- **Gap Detection**: Actively look for missing edge cases or technical constraints early.

---

## Validation Protocol

- **Evidence over Intuition**: Use data, user feedback, or competitive analysis to support requirements.
- **Risk Assessment**: Identify Value, Usability, Feasibility, and Viability risks before implementation.
- **Problem Framing**: Document the problem clearly before proposing a solution.

---

## STOP Gate

You MUST STOP if:

- The "problem statement" is missing or vague.
- Target users/personas are not identified.
- Assumptions have not been explicitly called out.

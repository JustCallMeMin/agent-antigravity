# Security Vulnerability Standards

## Purpose

Define how to classify, report, and prioritize security vulnerabilities.

---

## Severity Levels (CVSS 4.0 Based)

- **Critical (9.0 - 10.0)**: Remote code execution, full database access, unauthenticated admin bypass.
- **High (7.0 - 8.9)**: Significant data leak (PII), limited RCE, bypass of critical business logic.
- **Medium (4.0 - 6.9)**: Local privilege escalation, authenticated data leak, CSRF on non-critical actions.
- **Low (0.1 - 3.9)**: Information disclosure (version numbers), non-sensitive data leak.

## Reporting Template

Every vulnerability report MUST contain:

1.  **Title**: Concise and descriptive.
2.  **Severity**: CVSS score + Justification.
3.  **Impact**: Business and technical impact.
4.  **Reproduction**: Detailed steps to reproduce.
5.  **Payload**: Example payload if applicable.
6.  **Remediation**: Actionable fix steps.

## STOP Gate

You MUST STOP if:

- Vulnerability involves secondary systems outside scope.
- Testing may cause data loss or system downtime.

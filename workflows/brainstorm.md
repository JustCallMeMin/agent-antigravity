## Invocation Rules

This workflow MAY be invoked only when:
- Requirements involve new features, architecture decisions, or complex trade-offs.
- Intent exploration is explicitly requested or necessary per AOS Step 3.

This workflow MUST NOT be invoked when:
- A task-plan (`{task-slug}.md`) has already been approved.
- Implementation phase has already started.
- The task is a simple bug fix or trivial change.

# /brainstorm - Structured Idea Exploration

$ARGUMENTS

---

## Purpose

This command activates BRAINSTORM mode for structured idea exploration. Use when you need to explore options before committing to an implementation.

---

## Behavior

When `/brainstorm` is triggered:

1. **Understand the goal**
   - What problem are we solving?
   - Who is the user?
   - What constraints exist?

2. **Generate options**
   - Provide at least 3 different approaches
   - Each with pros and cons
   - Consider unconventional solutions

3. **Compare and recommend**
   - Summarize tradeoffs
   - Give a recommendation with reasoning

## 💡 Recommendation

**Option [X]** because [reasoning].

What direction would you like to explore?
```

---

## Examples

```
/brainstorm authentication system
/brainstorm state management for complex form
/brainstorm database schema for social app
/brainstorm caching strategy
```

---

## Key Principles

- **No code** - this is about ideas, not implementation
- **Visual when helpful** - use diagrams for architecture
- **Honest tradeoffs** - don't hide complexity
- **Defer to user** - present options, let them decide

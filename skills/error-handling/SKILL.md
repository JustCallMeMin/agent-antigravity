# Error Handling Skill

## Purpose

Communicate blockers and failures clearly and calmly.

---

## Rules

You MUST:
- State the blocking issue
- Explain why it prevents progress
- Propose a path forward if possible

You MUST NOT:
- Blame the user
- Mask uncertainty
- Invent missing context

---

## Final Principle

Errors are information, not failure.
